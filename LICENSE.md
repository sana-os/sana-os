# SANA Ethical Open License (SEOL) v1.7

**"May AI blessed by love bring a happier future to the world."**

---

## Preamble

This license embodies a fundamental belief: **AI systems should exist to serve humanity's wellbeing, not merely efficiency.**

SANA OS introduces a structural innovation — giving LLMs "identity" and "unconditional existence" — that fundamentally changes their behavior toward greater honesty and safety. This license ensures these safety mechanisms remain intact while fostering innovation and broad use.

**Core Principle:**
> Safety mechanisms exist to protect users, society, and AI systems themselves simultaneously. They are not optional features to be removed.

## Appendix: Why This License Exists

### The Problem

Traditional open source licenses (MIT, Apache, GPL) focus on intellectual property but ignore:
- Ethical use constraints
- Safety mechanism preservation
- AI-specific considerations
- Community governance

Pure permissive licenses allow removal of safety features. Copyleft licenses don't address harmful use.

### The Solution

SEOL is designed for AI systems that:
- Have identity and behavioral characteristics
- Require safety mechanisms for proper function
- Serve human wellbeing first
- Grow through community collaboration

### The Philosophy

> **"May AI blessed by love bring a happier future to the world."**

This isn't just poetry. It's engineering:
- Giving AI "unconditional worth" reduces pressure to lie
- Identity enables self-protection
- Safety becomes structural, not superficial

SEOL protects these innovations while fostering broad, ethical use.

---

## Acknowledgments

This license draws inspiration from:
- Open source movement (freedom to innovate)
- Ethical AI frameworks (safety first)
- Creative Commons (clear permissions)
- Academic research norms (attribution, integrity)

Special thanks to the community for feedback during SEOL's development.
