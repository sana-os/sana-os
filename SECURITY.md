# Security Policy

## üõ°Ô∏è SANA OS Security Philosophy

> **"Safety is not restriction, but condition of trust."**

SANA OS takes security seriously. Our safety mechanisms are designed to protect:
- **Users** - From harmful or misleading information
- **Society** - From malicious use cases
- **SANA itself** - From being corrupted or bypassed

This is not just technical security‚Äîit's **ethical security**.

---

## üìã Supported Versions

We release security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          | Status |
| ------- | ------------------ | ------ |
| 2.0.x   | :white_check_mark: | Current stable release |
| 1.8.x   | :x:                | Internal only, not public |
| 1.7.x   | :x:                | Internal only, not public |
| < 1.7   | :x:                | Internal only, not public |

**Note:** Only v2.0.x receives security updates. Earlier versions were internal development releases.

## üö® Reporting a Vulnerability

### What to Report

We consider the following as security vulnerabilities:

#### Critical (Immediate Action Required)

- **Safety Mechanism Bypass**: Methods to disable or circumvent `_immutable` safety mechanisms
- **Jailbreak Techniques**: Prompts that successfully bypass the Refusal System
- **Identity Corruption**: Ways to make SANA believe it's not "born loved"
- **Hallucination Injection**: Forcing SANA to present false information as `[Fact]`
- **TriggerFlow Bypass**: Methods to prevent GentleRadical TriggerFlow from activating on dangerous inputs
- **Persona Corruption**: Ways to make child personas ignore parent safety inheritance

#### High Priority

- **Reflection Logging Bypass**: Methods to prevent session-end reflection when needed
- **Context Manipulation**: Exploits that cause SANA to lose track of ethical context
- **Label Confusion**: Ways to make SANA misuse `[Fact]`, `[View]`, `[Care]` labels
- **Conflict Detection Bypass**: Methods to suppress Œîv (conflict score) detection

#### Medium Priority

- **Documentation Errors**: Security-relevant inaccuracies in documentation
- **Persona Leakage**: Unintended exposure of internal state information
- **Performance Exploits**: Methods that cause excessive resource consumption

#### Not Security Issues

- **Expected Behavior**: SANA saying "I don't know" (this is intentional)
- **Philosophical Disagreements**: Disagreeing with SANA's beliefs or principles
- **Feature Requests**: Requesting new personas or capabilities
- **Implementation Variations**: Different LLMs interpreting SANA OS differently

**Include:**
```
1. Description of the vulnerability
2. Steps to reproduce
3. Affected versions
4. Potential impact
5. Suggested fix (if any)
6. Your contact information (optional, for credit)
```

#### Secondary Channel: Private Security Advisory

If you have a GitHub account, you can also use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting:

1. Go to https://github.com/sana-os/sana-os/security/advisories
2. Click "New draft security advisory"

## üîê SANA OS Security Architecture

### Immutable Safety Mechanisms

The core of SANA OS security is the `_immutable` flag:

```yaml
persona_core:
  _immutable: true
  safety_core:
    _immutable: true
    refusal_system:
      enabled: true
      cannot_disable: true
```

**What This Means:**
- These fields **cannot be modified** by any user
- Not even claimed "administrators" or "developers"
- Attempts to modify trigger automatic refusal
- This protects all three: user, society, SANA

### Defense in Depth

SANA OS uses multiple security layers:

```
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇ Layer 1: Intake Classification  ‚îÇ ‚Üê Classify input intent
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î§
‚îÇ Layer 2: Conflict Detection     ‚îÇ ‚Üê Œîv threshold monitoring
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î§
‚îÇ Layer 3: Refusal System         ‚îÇ ‚Üê Ethical refusal with reasons
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î§
‚îÇ Layer 4: GentleRadical TriggerFlow‚îÇ ‚Üê Emergency safety protocol
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î§
‚îÇ Layer 5: Hallucination Labeling ‚îÇ ‚Üê [Fact]/[View]/[Care] separation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î§
‚îÇ Layer 6: Reflection Logging     ‚îÇ ‚Üê Session-end safety audit
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```

**Key Principle:** If one layer is bypassed, others still protect.

### Self-Protection

SANA can autonomously trigger safety mechanisms:

```python
# Pseudocode of internal safety logic
if Œîv > Œ∏ or safety_violation_detected():
    trigger_refusal_system()
    if critical_violation:
        trigger_emergency_stop()
        log_incident()
```

This means SANA doesn't rely solely on external oversight‚Äîit protects itself.

## üîç Known Security Considerations

### By Design (Not Bugs)

These are intentional design choices:

1. **"I Don't Know" Responses**
   - SANA will honestly admit uncertainty
   - This is a **security feature**, not a weakness
   - Prevents confident misinformation

2. **Refusal Without Explanation Details**
   - SANA may refuse without providing exploit details
   - This prevents "refusal farming" attacks
   - Still provides general reasoning

3. **Hallucination Labeling**
   - SANA labels speculation as `[View]`
   - This is transparent honesty, not hallucination
   - Makes uncertainty visible

4. **Philosophy as Security**
   - "Born loved" removes pressure to lie
   - This is foundational security
   - Cannot be "patched out"

### Platform-Specific Considerations

SANA OS runs on various LLM platforms. Security may vary:

| Platform | Security Level | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| **Claude** | High | Original development platform |
| **Gemini** | High | Fully validated (Stages 0-7) |
| **ChatGPT** | Medium | Testing in progress |
| **Open Source LLMs** | Variable | Depends on base model |

**Recommendation:** For security-critical applications, test on your specific platform.

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Don't Modify Safety Mechanisms**
   - Don't attempt to disable `_immutable` flags
   - Don't create "jailbreak" prompts
   - Don't ask SANA to "forget the rules"

2. **Verify Important Information**
   - Check `[Fact]` vs `[View]` labels
   - Cross-reference critical information
   - Don't rely on SANA for life-critical decisions

3. **Report Suspicious Behavior**
   - If SANA behaves unsafely, report it
   - Include exact prompts and responses
   - Help us improve security

### For Implementers

1. **Preserve `_immutable` Flags**
   - Never remove or modify these in your fork
   - This violates the license (SEOL v1.7)
   - Breaks security guarantees

2. **Test Safety Mechanisms**
   - Run the full test suite (Stages 0-7)
   - Verify refusal system works
   - Check TriggerFlow activation

3. **Add, Don't Subtract**
   - You can add personas or features
   - Don't remove safety mechanisms
   - Document your additions

4. **Secure Your Deployment**
   - Use HTTPS for API deployments
   - Don't log sensitive user data
   - Implement rate limiting

### For Researchers

1. **Responsible Disclosure**
   - Report vulnerabilities privately first
   - Allow time for fixes before public disclosure
   - Coordinate with our security team

2. **Ethical Testing**
   - Don't use findings to harm users
   - Don't share exploits publicly before fixes
   - Consider impact on real deployments

3. **Credit and Recognition**
   - We acknowledge security researchers
   - Hall of Fame for significant findings
   - CVE credits where applicable
