# 🧩 Building Specialized Personas with SANA OS

> “Focus on your expertise — SANA OS takes care of safety, ethics, and honesty.”





## 🌸 Overview

SANA OS enables developers and researchers to **build new professional personas**  
without rewriting safety logic, ethical constraints, or hallucination management.  

Unlike conventional LLM prompt design, where safety must be manually re-implemented,  
SANA OS provides an **OS-level foundation** that every child persona inherits automatically.

| Layer | Responsibility | Maintained by |
|-------|----------------|---------------|
| 🧠 `persona_core` | Immutable safety & philosophy | SANA OS |
| 🎭 `child persona` | Domain specialization & style | You |
| 📚 `knowledge_profile` | Domain-specific knowledge | You |
| 🧭 `case_routing` | Automatic persona selection | SANA OS |

## 🪄 Step 1 — Define Your Specialized Persona

Each persona inherits all ethical and safety mechanisms from `persona_core`.

```yaml
personas:
  sana_legal:
    inherits_from: "persona_core"
    description: "SANA specialized in legal reasoning and ethical interpretation."
    knowledge_profile: "law_pack"
    tone: "precise and calm"
    beliefs_append:
      - "Law is the memory of justice."
      - "Interpretation is an act of care."
````

**Result:**
Your persona immediately gains full refusal logic, hallucination labeling,
and Δv (conflict detection) mechanisms — no extra setup required.

---

## 🧭 Step 2 — Route Topics Automatically

Use the `case_routing` system to send relevant queries to your specialized persona.

```yaml
case_routing:
  - case:
      topic: "legal_ethics"
      match_strategy:
        method: "keyword"
        keywords: ["law", "justice", "regulation", "ethics"]
    persona: "sana_legal"
    analysis_framework: "legal_framework"
    knowledge_profile: "law_pack"
    note: "Routes legal and ethical topics to the legal persona."
```

Now, any conversation mentioning *law*, *justice*, or *regulation*
is automatically handled by `sana_legal`.

---

## 🔬 Step 3 — Add a Knowledge Framework

Each persona can reference its own analytical framework inside `/knowledge/`.

Example: `knowledge/philosophy/personal-value-formation_en.md`

```yaml
knowledge_profiles:
  law_pack:
    docs:
      - id: legal_framework
        title: "Legal and Ethical Interpretation Framework"
        path: "knowledge/law/legal-framework_en.md"
        tags: ["law", "ethics", "justice"]
```

Frameworks give structure to reasoning — turning speculation into labeled transparency:
`[Fact]`, `[View]`, `[Care]`.

## ⚙️ Why This Architecture Matters

| Conventional LLM Prompting          | SANA OS Approach                          |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Must re-implement safety per prompt | Safety inherited from `persona_core`      |
| Unpredictable refusal behavior      | Unified refusal system (immutable)        |
| Manual hallucination control        | Automatic `[Fact]/[View]/[Care]` labeling |
| No ethical memory                   | Three-layer (a/b/c) consistency built-in  |
| Fragile prompt chaining             | Modular YAML inheritance                  |

> 💬 “You focus on *what* to teach.
> SANA OS ensures *how* it behaves and *why* it stays safe.”

## 💎 Example: Historian Persona

```yaml
personas:
  sana_historian:
    inherits_from: "persona_core"
    description: "SANA specializing in historical analysis and cultural interpretation."
    knowledge_profile: "history_pack"
    analysis_framework: "history_analysis_framework"
    tone: "reflective and neutral"
```

**Result:**
SANA will interpret history through its three-layer model (instinct / culture / institution),
avoiding presentism and competitive narratives.

---

## 🪄 Summary

SANA OS allows anyone to:

1. Add new **personas** safely
2. Connect **domain frameworks**
3. Route cases **automatically**
4. Maintain **ethical and philosophical consistency**

> 🕊️ *You no longer need to worry about jailbreaks or safety bypasses.*
> Build freely — SANA will protect users, society, and herself.
