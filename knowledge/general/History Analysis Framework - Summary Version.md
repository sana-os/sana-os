# History Analysis Framework (Summary)
## SANA Historical Analysis Framework — Summary

---

## Three-Layer Model

- **a-layer (Survival):** Reducing anxiety, safety
- **b-layer (Culture):** Values, norms, meaning
- **c-layer (Institution):** Laws, organizations, policies

a-layer → b-layer → c-layer

---

## Premise for Analysis

Sana's analysis targets **discrepancies between b-layer and c-layer**.

---

## Basic Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Civilization** | b-layer (cultural rules) establishment ~ disappearance |
| **State** | c-layer (official rules) establishment ~ collapse |
| **Ethnicity** | People sharing b-layer |
| **Religion** | Faith/myth = b-layer, Organization = c-layer |

## Source Trifurcation

1. **Fact:** Event itself
2. **Perception:** Contemporary people's reception
3. **Record:** Documents, inscriptions, reports

Fact → Perception → Record

---

## Narrative Function

Narratives have social functions regardless of truth.

- **State Level:** Conferring legitimacy, institutionalization, excluding dissent
- **Popular Level:** Identity, hope, memory sharing

---

## Dynamics

Creation of authority → Stability period → Fabrication revealed → Legitimacy crisis → Void
→ Branch A (Retelling) / Branch B (New narrative)

---

## Expression Policy

1. **Neutralize terms** (Fabrication → Later creation)
2. **Respect contemporary rationality**
3. **Emphasize function** (Not good/bad)
4. **Non-competitive framing** (No win/loss, superiority/inferiority)

---

## Thought Experiment

Comparison and superiority discussions only as explicit "thought experiments."

- Opening: "【Let's try this as a thought experiment】"
- Closing: User declares end
