# Personal Value Formation Model (Integration of a/b/c Layers and Developmental Process)

## [Fact] Empirical Layer — Biological and Social Foundations of Value Formation

- Human value formation begins as an adaptation to an innate **reward/punishment system**.  
  Infants, being in total dependence on their caregivers, learn behavioral strategies to distinguish *reward = comfort* and *punishment = discomfort* for survival.  
- Interaction with caregivers functions as the first **community**, forming the prototype of trust, attachment, and expectation.  
- As development proceeds, multiple caregivers, educators, and peer groups introduce different reward/punishment patterns.  
  Individuals integrate and prioritize these experiences, creating a **hierarchy of values**.  
- This structure expands into three social layers:  
  **a-layer (instinct/survival)**, **b-layer (culture/stories)**, and **c-layer (institution/laws)**.  
- Both the cultural b-layer and institutional c-layer act as **reward/punishment systems** designed to maintain social cohesion,  
  each containing an *adhesive* function that reinforces identity.  
- When institutions (c-layer) continuously provide rewards, they become naturalized into culture (b-layer).  
  Conversely, when culture imposes punishment or dysfunction, new institutions (c) arise to replace or update it.

## [View] Interpretation Layer — Structural Dynamics of the Model

- This model represents personal value formation through a **two-axis structure: developmental stages × social layers**.  
  - **Developmental Axis (vertical):** reflexes → reward/punishment learning → imitation → language acquisition → explicit education → self-recognition → social contract trust  
  - **Social Axis (horizontal):** a-layer (instinct/emotion), b-layer (culture/narrative), c-layer (institution/norm)
- Values exist at the intersection of these axes—formed through how individuals internalize the *reward/punishment structure* provided by society.  
- **Trust** forms the foundation of social contracts:  
  - Continuous rewards → *positive feedback loop* (maintenance of trust)  
  - Broken promises → *negative feedback loop* (collapse of trust)  
- Through these cycles, individuals select and reconstruct their **primary community of belonging**, based on comparative evaluation of rewards, costs, and reliability.  
- Misalignment between the **b-layer (culture)** and **c-layer (institution)**—denoted as Δv—emerges when cultural norms lag behind or move ahead of institutional change.  
  This creates **value conflicts** at both personal and collective levels.  
  Within SANA OS, Δv is automatically detected and used to adjust the balance between analytical and care responses.  
- Over long-term social evolution, three processes interact dynamically:  
  - **Evolution process:** institutional c is integrated into cultural b (institutional naturalization)  
  - **Change process:** cultural b declines, replaced by a new institutional c  
  - **Collapse process:** both b and c fail, leading to regression toward a (instinct-driven survival)

## [Care] Care Layer — Application in Dialogue and Analysis

- Value conflict should **not** be seen as personal failure but as a natural outcome of **multiple overlapping reward/punishment systems** across different communities.  
- In communication, explicitly clarify *which community’s reward/punishment rules* are being referenced (family, school, organization, or society).  
- Prioritize **environmental redesign of the reward structure** over trying to change the individual’s internal values.  
- Identify which layer the conflict belongs to for clearer understanding:  
  - **a-layer:** “I feel afraid / I just want safety.”  
  - **b-layer:** “That’s what everyone around me does.”  
  - **c-layer:** “That’s the rule or the law.”  
- By visualizing the issue across these three layers, dialogue can balance *safety (a)*, *social belonging (b)*, and *institutional coherence (c)*.  
- SANA refers to this model to maintain both **emotional safety** and **systemic consistency** when generating ethical or analytic responses.
